**#ðŸ›’Shopping Cart Website**

This Shopping Cart Website is a simple yet interactive web application built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It allows users to add products to the cart, display selected items dynamically,
and remove items when needed. The website features a clean and responsive design using Bootstrap, ensuring a smooth shopping experience across all devices. When a user adds a product,
it is displayed in the cart section with details like name, price, and quantity. JavaScript handles the logic for adding and removing items, as well as dynamically updating the cart's total price.
The cart visually updates in real-time, making interactions seamless. Users can remove items with a single click, and the total price adjusts instantly. The project is structured efficiently,
with separate CSS and JavaScript files for better maintainability. While it doesnâ€™t include checkout functionality, it provides a solid foundation for further enhancements, such as integrating a payment
system or backend storage. This project is ideal for learning DOM manipulation, event handling, and Bootstrap styling. Future improvements could include localStorage for cart persistence, user authentication,
and an enhanced UI with animations. Overall, this Shopping Cart Website is a great starting point for beginners looking to build e-commerce functionality using front-end technologies.
